# Contributing

Thanks for wanting to help. Ito-verse is a non-commercial fan project (see [LICENSE](LICENSE) and
[NOTICE](NOTICE)); by contributing you agree your contribution is offered under the same terms as the part you touch.

## Before anything

1. Read [docs/THEME_ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/THEME_ARCHITECTURE.md) and [docs/COMPONENTS.md](docs/COMPONENTS.md): how it is
   built, and what is ours, what is a fork and what is Omarchy's.
2. Run the shell on a machine you can afford to break, and keep `ito-health` open.

## The working loop

```bash
# edit the repository, then:
scripts/check-qml.sh          # lints the Control Centre pages and shared components (catches a page that would not load)
scripts/deploy.sh             # copies onto ~/.config/omarchy; stops the shell first if it must, restarts it once
bar/modules/bin/ito-health --text     # must end with no WARN or FAIL
```

- Restart only with `ito-restart`. Never `pkill quickshell` (it kills your terminal too) and never a bare
  `omarchy-launch-shell`: two of those give two bars.
- `deploy.sh` is the only way to put files on the running shell. Copying them by hand while it runs can retire the bar.
- Look at your change on screen: `omarchy-shell ito.controlcenter page <name>` opens a page without clicking, and
  `scripts/lab/render.sh` renders a QML scene off screen.
- Before a bigger change run `python3 scripts/qa/sweep-settings.py`: it sets every option on the live shell one value at a
  time and asks Health after each whether an error appeared. It restores your settings at the end.

## Rules that keep it working

- **Health stays at zero.** A new error path gets a note in the `KNOWN` table of `bar/modules/bin/ito-health` (what it means,
  and a `fixId` when there is a safe fix) and `bar/modules/bin/ito-health --table > docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`.
- **Settings** live in `ito-style.json` through `ito-config`. A new key goes into `INTS`/`BOOLS`/`FLOATS`/`DEFAULT_ON` in
  `bar/modules/bin/ito-config` or it is stored as text.
- **Code, comments, commit messages and docs in English**; UI text in plain English.
- **Conventional commits**, one unit of work each.
- **QML:** in a delegate, refer to things by `id`, not `parent`; an `Image` `source` is evaluated even when hidden, so guard
  it when the file may not exist; never load a picture a user has not chosen yet.
- **Art:** the style is fine bone linework on black, red only where it bleeds. Draw for the size it is shown at (29 px on the
  bar) and look at it there. Do not add art you do not have the right to include.
- **Do not touch** what is not ours: `/usr/share`, Omarchy's own files, other people's plugins.

## Reporting a bug

Open Health → **Copy report for an AI assistant** (or `ito-health --report`) and attach it. It says what is wrong, describes
the machine and includes the log, which is most of what is needed.
