# shell is running, it is restarted cleanly afterwards instead of being left to reload itself.
# The running shell reloads a plugin the moment its files change. A reload while the engine's signature is stale retires
# the Ito-verse bar for good (the engine then falls back to another bar and rewrites shell.json), and a reload can also
# leave the old generation's bar on screen beside the new one. So when there is anything to copy and a shell is
# running, the shell is stopped first, the files are copied, the signature is made to match, and it is started again.
# What would actually change: a checksum comparison, leaving out what is the user's or generated (settings, signatures).
